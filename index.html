                <h2>One Wave</h2>
                <p>I was invited to go surfing and it turned to be a group of people who are a part of this initiative called One Wave. The purpose is to check in on friends on a weekly basis to ensure that ones mental health is in a good place. We started off in a circle and shared with one another where we're at and I was in awe. It's a totally awesome thing they are doing and I look forward to meeting with them again. Click <a href="http://www.onewavesurf.com/">HERE</a> to check em out!</p>
